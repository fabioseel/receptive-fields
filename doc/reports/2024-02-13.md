## Staggered Convolutions
Stride 3, Kernel Size 5:

- smoother, but no improvement in task performance worse (ok, a little for extreme cases maybe?)
- worth continuing? not clear how efficient it can be implemented
    - put in backlog, maybe check again at some point

## Talk about NeurIPS plan

## RF quantification
- Fourier spectre?
  - angle / n frequency components
  - with added gaussian -> more general than Gabors
  - not so good for center surround / circular shapes
  - obviously does not work as well for more complex RFs
  - "easy" detection of noisiness and high frequency patterns
