# Update 2024-03-12

## RF Classifier

- labeled "bigger" dataset
- performance... ok_ish?
- relabel so questionable rfs are automatically "unclassifiable"? (too have less false positives) and use for finetuning?
- TODO: statistical analysis of frequency of shapes in layers x in different conditions

## Lindsey & Bottleneck update

- trained with input in range (0,1) - did the same cause I wanted to reproduce, but training a lot more stable when input values centered at 0
  - potentially rerun and see whether different hyperparams are possible
- bottleneck with downsampling:
  - TODO: reproduce the areadne thing, but with bottleneck

## Analysis & Future directions

- analyze established / baseline models instead of "own"  modifications
  - might be nice for motivation to build on previous work / connect to literature
  - eg some of the trained models here, cause they are also rl under different settings could be a nice starting point:
    - <https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3/tree/master>
  - also continue with some of the "big" models that are available through pytorch
  - some model trained to predict neural activity from img input
    - eg SENSORIUM 2022 winner <https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/advs.202305626>
- vastly different visualization technique:
    - eg Rastermap <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.25.550571v2>

## Neuro JC next week

- Rastermap? <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.25.550571v2>
  - find groups / clusters of neuronal activity / sorts neurons
  - also applied to CNN Responses to images / image sequences (not exactly sure whether responses are discretized for that case?)
- SENSORIUM winner: <https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/advs.202305626>
  - uses additional input channels (object position) created through object detection networks
  - ensemble strategy
